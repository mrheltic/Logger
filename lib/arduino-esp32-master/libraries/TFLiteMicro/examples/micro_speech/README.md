# Micro Speech Example

This example shows how to run a 20 kB model that can recognize 2 keywords,
"yes" and "no", from speech data.

The application listens to its surroundings with a microphone and indicates
when it has detected a word by displaying data on a screen.

## Deploy to ESP32

The sample has been tested on ESP-IDF version `release/v4.2` and `release/v4.4` with the following devices:
- [ESP32-DevKitC](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/get-started-devkitc.html)
- [ESP32-S3-DevKitC](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/hw-reference/esp32s3/user-guide-devkitc-1.html)
- [ESP-EYE](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who/blob/master/docs/en/get-started/ESP-EYE_Getting_Started_Guide.md)

### Sample output

  * When a keyword is detected you will see following output sample output on the log screen:

```
Heard yes (<score>) at <time>
```
